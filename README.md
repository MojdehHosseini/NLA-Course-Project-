# NLA_project
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced sentiment analysis system that goes beyond traditional models by incorporating feature grammar to handle more complex cases. The enhanced system is specifically tailored to analyze movie reviews, not only determining the overall sentiment but also identifying the stance towards specific named entities mentioned in the text (e.g., actors, directors).

Objectives
Feature Grammar Integration: Implement feature grammar to better understand and analyze complex sentence structures, idioms, and nuanced expressions.
Baseline Comparison: Compare the performance of the enhanced system with a baseline sentiment analysis model.
Stance Identification: Extend the system to identify the reviewer's stance towards particular named entities in the movie reviews.
